                Virat Kohli is an Indian international cricketer and former captain of the Indian national team who
                plays as a right-handed batsman for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and for Delhi in Indian
                domestic cricket.
                Virat Kohli was born on the 5th of November in 1988 in Delhi. His father was Prem Kohli and his mother
                Saroj Kohli. His father worked as a lawyer and he passed away in December 19th, 2006 due to brain
                stroke. Virat has an elder brother, Vikash and an elder sister, Bhavna. He had his schooling in St.
                Sofia School in Paschim Vihar, Delhi.
                Virat Kohli was among the first intake of The West Delhi Cricket Academy which was created in 1998.
                Virat was included in the Delhi Ranji team on 23rd November 2006. He played his first match against
                Tamil Nadu. Virat became famous when he played for Delhi in the Ranji trophy, a match against Karnataka.
                He scored 90 in that match. On that day only (19th December 2006), at 3 oclock in the morning, his dad
                passed away due to brain stroke.

                Virat played his first T 20 match against Himachal Pradesh at Delhi on the 3rd of April 2007. In 2008,
                he was the captain of the under 19 Indian Cricket team in the World Cup and India also won that match.
                He is also a part of Royal Challengers Bangalore from the year 2008.

                He made his debut In One Day International against Sri Lanka in the Ideal Cup in 2008, when both the
                great batsman Virat Tendulkar and Virendar Sewag were injured. In the first match Virat was not able to
                prove him that much since he got out for 12 runs, but in the second match he scored a crucial 37 runs,
                which helped India win the match and level the series. Virat scored his first half century in the fourth
                match, which helped India win the series against Sri Lanka. This win was very special for India since it
                was Indias first win against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka.

                In January 2009, Virat Kohli was dropped from the squad for the fifth ODI series in Sri Lanka against
                Sri Lanka. He then played in 2009 ICC Champions Trophy since Yuvraj Singh was injured and was not able
                to play in that match. Virat scored his first ODI Century in the 4th ODI in December 2009. Once Yuvraj
                became fit, Virat was only able to play occasionally.
                Virat Kohli married to Bollywood Actress Anushka Sharma on 11 December 2017. In January 2021 they had a daughter named
                Vamika Kohli.
